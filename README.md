# Wikify
Wikipedia search made easier now!

What for?
------
All the code was made just for fun and practice - to test how the Wikipedia API works.

How to use?
------
Just enter what you want to find and hit 'Search'. There will be a small wildcard with short info on your request.
If you don't know  what to search - let Wiki do this for you pressing 'Random article'.

Can I use the code?
------
Yes you can! The project was made to help myself and others practice a little and to understand how the APIs work.

Have fun!
